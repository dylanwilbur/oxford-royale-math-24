Introduction to Python using MIT's Open Courseware '[Introduction To Computer Science And Programming In Python](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/pages/lecture-slides-code/)'. In class, we covered the first three weeks of material, referencing the attached lecture slides. We also completed all problems in problem set 1 and 2, also attached below. More information can be found at the link above.

Improving at python and programming in general is certainly helped by a class such as the one above, but you can only truly grow your skill by doing practice problems. I recommend the problems over at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).

3Blue1Brown's series on Calculus is also included here as homework, to give us a conceptual understanding before diving into calculus later.
