Today, we looked at some more python examples, and how we can use coding principles to illustrate calculus concepts. We also studied the ideas of limits and convergence. Specifically, we looked at problem set 2 from MIT's Open Courseware python course, as well as the cube root approximation methods. Code for the approximating root 3 can be found below, as well as code for the animations. We use 3Blue1Brown's manim library to illustrate the difference in the rate of convergence, or time complexity, of two different algorithms for finding the cube root of various numbers.
