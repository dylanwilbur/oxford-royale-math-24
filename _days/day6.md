## Session 1: Sequences and Series
- Topic 18 in Student Handbook and Workbook
- Register for event [here](https://simons.berkeley.edu/web-registration-simons-institute-summer-2024-public-lectures)
- Geoguessr link [here](https://www.geoguessr.com/challenge/OaVuOYU2JYpvFaKL)

**Agenda**

Quick lecture on:
- Notation: $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n$
- Some vocab:
  - Arithmetic Sequence: (adding a constant term)$a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d$
  - Geometric Sequence: (multiplying a constant term) $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n - 1)}$
  - Recursive definition: $a_n = a_{n-1}*r$
  - Explicit definition: $a_n = a_1 \cdot r^{(n - 1)}$
- Handout 6
- Topic 18 in workbook
  - Code different estimates for series 

## Session 2: Convergence, Taylor Series
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d6DsjIBzJ4
- [Notes and Problems](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/SeriesIntro.aspx)
- Taking a look back at our code:
  - How can some of the code we wrote be viewed as sequences/series?
  - What can we say about their convergence? 
- Coding challenge:
  - Practice graphing by coding/graphing Taylor series

## Session 3: The Math of Machine Learning
- Linear algebra crash course
- Linear regression and least squares calculations
- Some examples with real data in code

## Session 4: More on AI and Machine Learning
- Modeling and Predictions from data
- Difference between modelling and machine learning
- More code examples and challenges
